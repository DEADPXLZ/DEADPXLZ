## Hello & welcome to DEADPXLZ! üññ

![DEADPXLZ_twitter_cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83417674/116793590-41df3a00-aad0-11eb-8c40-29a3d14fc32f.png)

**DEADPXLZ** is a collection of **10,000 code-generated, unique & interact-able NFTs** minted on the Cardano 
blockchain.

### What's special about these NFTs?
What makes DEADPXLZ special among the other NFT collectibles out there is that they're the first interact-able
tokens that have ever been minted on Cardano!

### ü§î What does 'interact-able NFT' even mean?
It means that you can change your PXL's mood & background animation with a simple tap or click.

Each DEADPXLZ NFT comes packed with 3 moods - **happy** üòä, **neutral** üòê & **sad** üôÅ <br>
**_Pro tip: Make your PXL happy & it will start winking back at you._**

In addition to this, all PXLZ also feature 8 different background animations which you can cycle through randomly by 
tapping or clicking on them.

### Still not impressed? <br>
What if I told you that if you double-tap or double-click your PXL, it will reveal its 
stats?

Yep - no need for a centralized 3rd party marketplace to host your token on in order to reveal how scarce it actually is! With DEADPXLZ, you can brag about that super rare stats right from within the actual NFT! You can close the stats panel by simply tapping anywhere on the screen.

üéà I call this _**EMBEDDED STATS**_ - a truly unique NFT feature brought to you for the first time ever on the 
blockchain by the DEADPXLZ project! 

### What about attributes?
There's a total of 69 üôÉ attributes which are combined together to  make each PXL unique.
In addition to this, there are 6 types of PXLZ:
- **DEAD** - the most common ones
- **VAMPIRES**
- **WEREWOLVES**
- **ALIENS**
- **REPTILIANS**
- **LEGENDARY** - 10 special PXLZ built as a tribute to some of the finest that pop-culture has to offer.

**One PXL can have from 0 to a maximum of 8 attributes most of which feature animated graphics. <br>**

### But how can an image respond to gestures?

Who ever said they're images? All DEADPXLZ NFTs are essentially web pages hosted on IPFS built with HTML, CSS & vanilla JS. Due to this technical aspect, you can literally display them on any device which supports an internet browser without sacrificing quality.

And I mean ANY device! Smartwatches? Yep. Phones, tablets? Sure! TVs? 100%! The scoreboard of the NY Yankees stadium? Especially!

All PXLZ have been designed to support any modern web browser and feature a fully responsive design which means that no matter the screen size or orientation, your PXL will scale accordingly. Oh & not to mention they're lightweight - the average size of 1 PXL is around 25Kb!

Another fun fact about them is that they're built to be social media friendly. This means that you can directly share the IPFS URL (no marketplace required!) of your PXL on Twitter or Facebook and its thumbnail along with its name & short description will pop up & then your friends or followers can check it out right within the app.

The thumbnail images embedded within each PXL are also registered as NFTs & hosted on IPFS, alongside your PXL! An NFT within an NFT! These are the only external resources loaded by a PXL which makes any 'tampering' with the token impossible.

You'll soon be able to explore the entire collection & purchase your own on the official website - https://pxlz.org

In the meantime you can check out a random PXL here: https://pxlz.org/random

I encourage you to try and get acquainted with as many as you can. Who knows, you might nab a rare or even legendary one during one of the sale events!

### How is the ownership of a DEADPXL NFT guaranteed?
All DEADPXLZ are inextricably tied to their respective mint transaction metadata which is stored on the Cardano blockchain upon minting the NFT. The metadata provides all the information related to that specific token.

In addition to the token attributes and type, the metadata also points to files which are stored on IPFS and as such are immutable thus guaranteeing to the owner of the token that he is also the current owner of said files.

All this information is publicly available on any of the Cardano blockchain explorers and can be viewed by navigating to your token's mint transaction: https://cardanoscan.io/tokenPolicy/0a3c905527ef7de685688edda978ba4b888e6a913f67c3bdc95d1a06

ü§ì If you want to go deeper down the rabbit hole, the mint tx metadata JSON template is available in <a href="https://github.com/DEADPXLZ/DEADPXLZ">the DEADPXLZ repo</a> & is compliant with the current <a href="https://github. com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/pull/85/commits/ed48e5a38b75eb31f16288338a3c1ef93fecde47">Cardano Metadata CIP NFT 721 standard</a>.
